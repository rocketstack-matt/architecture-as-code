# Defining Relationships

In CALM, **relationships** define how nodes interact with each other. These connections are what bring your architecture to life, showing how data and control flow through the system.

## Relationship Types

CALM supports several primary relationship types:

1. **connects**: Represents a connection between components, typically for communication
2. **deployed-in**: Shows that a component is deployed within another (like a container or network)
3. **composed-of**: Indicates that a component contains or is made up of other components
4. **interacts**: Used when actors (like users) interact with system components

## Relationship Structure

A basic relationship has the following properties:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the relationship
- **relationship-type**: The type of relationship (connects, deployed-in, etc.)
- **description**: A text explanation of the relationship

The `relationship-type` property defines which nodes are involved and how they're connected.
