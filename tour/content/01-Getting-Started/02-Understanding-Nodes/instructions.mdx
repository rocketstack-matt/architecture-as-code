# Understanding Nodes

In CALM, **nodes** represent the core components of your architecture. Nodes can be services, databases, user interfaces, external systems, or any other architectural element you need to define.

## Node Structure

Every node in CALM must have a few essential properties:

- **unique-id**: A string that uniquely identifies the node in your architecture
- **node-type**: Defines what kind of component this is (service, database, actor, etc.)
- **name**: A human-readable name for the component
- **description**: A text explanation of what this node does or represents

## Node Types

CALM supports various node types to represent different architectural components:

- **service**: An independent service or application
- **database**: A data storage component
- **system**: A higher-level system that may contain other nodes
- **actor**: A user or external entity that interacts with your system
- **network**: A networking component or boundary

There are many other node types available in CALM depending on your needs.

### Add a database node on the <SideEditorLink text="right side!"/> 
Complete the example by adding a database node that stores user data. Remember to include all required properties: `unique-id`, `node-type`, `name`, and `description`.
