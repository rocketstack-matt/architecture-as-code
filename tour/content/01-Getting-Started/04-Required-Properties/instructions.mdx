# Required Properties

Every CALM document must follow certain rules to be valid. Let's look at the core properties that are required in any CALM architecture.

## Top-Level Required Properties

A minimal valid CALM document must include:

- **$schema**: Reference to the CALM schema version being used
- **nodes**: An array of node definitions (at least one node)

Relationships aren't strictly required if you're just defining standalone components, but most practical architectures will include them.

## Required Node Properties

Every node must include the following properties:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the node
- **node-type**: The type of the node (service, database, etc.)
- **name**: A human-readable name

Description is highly recommended but not strictly required.

## Required Relationship Properties

Every relationship must include:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the relationship
- **relationship-type**: The type and structure of the relationship

Description is recommended but not strictly required for relationships as well.
