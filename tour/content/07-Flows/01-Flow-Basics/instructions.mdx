# Flow Basics

In CALM, **flows** represent processes and data flows through your architecture. They document how components interact to achieve specific business outcomes or technical processes.

## Flow Structure

A basic flow definition looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://calm.finos.org/draft/2025-03/meta/flow.json",
  "unique-id": "order-processing-flow",
  "name": "Order Processing Flow",
  "description": "Process an order from submission to fulfillment",
  "participants": [
    "customer",
    "order-service",
    "payment-service",
    "fulfillment-service"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "unique-id": "submit-order",
      "name": "Submit Order",
      "description": "Customer submits an order",
      "from": "customer",
      "to": "order-service",
      "sequence": 1
    },
    // Additional steps
  ]
}
```

## Key Flow Components

- **participants**: The nodes involved in the flow
- **steps**: The individual actions or interactions in the flow
- **sequence**: The order of steps in the flow

## Flow Steps

Each step in a flow represents an interaction between components and includes:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the step
- **name**: A human-readable name for the step
- **description**: A description of what happens in this step
- **from**: The source node for this interaction
- **to**: The destination node for this interaction
- **sequence**: The step's position in the flow
