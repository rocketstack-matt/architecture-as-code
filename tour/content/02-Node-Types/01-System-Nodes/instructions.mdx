# System Nodes

In CALM, **system nodes** represent higher-level containers or complete systems that can contain other nodes. System nodes help you organize your architecture into logical units and show system boundaries.

## System Node Properties

System nodes have the standard node properties:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the system
- **node-type**: Always set to `"system"` for system nodes
- **name**: A human-readable name for the system
- **description**: A description of what the system does or represents

## System Composition

A key aspect of system nodes is that they can have a composition relationship with other nodes through the `"composed-of"` relationship type. This allows you to create hierarchical architectures where systems contain subsystems or components.

## Example Use Cases

System nodes are ideal for representing:

- A complete application
- A business domain boundary
- A logical grouping of microservices
- A deployable unit that contains multiple components
