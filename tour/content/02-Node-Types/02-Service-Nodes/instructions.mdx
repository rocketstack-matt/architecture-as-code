# Service Nodes

In CALM, **service nodes** represent individual services, APIs, applications, or processes that perform specific functions in your architecture. Services are typically the most common components in modern system designs.

## Service Node Properties

Service nodes have the standard node properties plus some additional attributes:

- **unique-id**: A unique identifier for the service
- **node-type**: Set to `"service"` for service nodes
- **name**: A human-readable name for the service
- **description**: A description of what the service does
- **run-as**: (Optional) The security context the service runs as (e.g., "systemId")
- **data-classification**: (Optional) The classification of data handled by the service

## Service Interfaces

Services often expose interfaces that other components can connect to. These can be defined using the `interfaces` property, which we'll explore in a later lesson.

## Example Use Cases

Service nodes are used to represent:

- Microservices in a distributed system
- API endpoints or gateways
- Backend processes and daemons
- Frontend applications
