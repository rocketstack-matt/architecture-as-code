# Control Fundamentals

In CALM, **controls** define requirements and validation rules that your architecture must meet. They help ensure compliance with security standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational policies.

## Control Types

CALM supports several types of controls:

- **Flow Controls**: Applied to specific flows in your architecture
- **Security Controls**: Focused on security aspects like authentication and encryption
- **Compliance Controls**: Ensure adherence to specific standards and regulations

## Control Structure

A basic control definition looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://calm.finos.org/draft/2025-03/meta/control.json",
  "unique-id": "data-encryption-control",
  "name": "Data Encryption Control",
  "description": "Ensures sensitive data is encrypted in transit",
  "control-type": "security",
  "requirements": [
    {
      "unique-id": "https-requirement",
      "description": "All connections must use HTTPS",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Control Application

Controls can be applied to specific flows or relationships in your architecture. This is typically done through a control configuration that maps control requirements to specific architectural elements.
