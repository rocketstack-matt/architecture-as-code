# Adding Metadata

In CALM, **metadata** allows you to add context and custom information to your architecture. This can include security classifications, compliance tags, operational data, and any other information that helps describe or categorize your components.

## Where to Add Metadata

Metadata can be added to:

- Individual nodes
- Relationships
- The entire architecture
- Flows and steps

## Common Metadata Properties

Some common metadata properties include:

- **data-classification**: The security classification of data (e.g., "Public", "Confidential", "PII")
- **run-as**: The security context a service runs as
- **owner**: The team or person responsible for a component
- **version**: The version of a component
- **status**: The lifecycle status of a component (e.g., "planned", "active", "deprecated")

## Custom Metadata

You can add any custom metadata properties to your nodes and relationships as needed. This allows you to extend CALM with organization-specific information.

```json
{
  "unique-id": "order-service",
  "node-type": "service",
  "name": "Order Service",
  "description": "Handles order processing",
  "data-classification": "Confidential",
  "owner": "Order Team",
  "status": "active",
  "custom-attribute": "custom value"
}
```
