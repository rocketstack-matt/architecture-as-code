# Understanding Architecture Patterns

In CALM, **architecture patterns** define reusable templates for common architectural structures. They're like blueprints that you can apply to ensure consistency and best practices across your organization's systems.

## Pattern Structure

A CALM pattern is defined using a special variant of the CALM schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://calm.finos.org/draft/2025-03/meta/calm.json",
  "$id": "https://example.com/patterns/api-gateway",
  "title": "API Gateway Pattern",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "nodes": {
      "type": "array",
      "minItems": 3,
      "prefixItems": [
        {
          "$ref": "https://calm.finos.org/draft/2025-03/meta/core.json#/defs/node",
          "properties": {
            "node-type": { "const": "system" },
            "name": { "const": "API Gateway" },
            "unique-id": { "const": "api-gateway" }
          }
        },
        // Additional node definitions
      ]
    },
    "relationships": {
      // Pattern relationship definitions
    }
  },
  "required": ["nodes", "relationships"]
}
```

## How Patterns Work

Patterns define a structure that implementations must follow. They can:

1. Require specific nodes and relationships
2. Define constraints on properties
3. Set minimum requirements for components
4. Allow for customization within constraints

## Common Patterns

Some common architecture patterns include:

- API Gateway Pattern
- Microservice Architecture Pattern
- Event-Driven Architecture Pattern
- Layered Architecture Pattern
