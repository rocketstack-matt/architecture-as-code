# Deployed-in Relationships

The **deployed-in** relationship type in CALM represents that nodes are deployed or contained within another node. This is commonly used to show deployment contexts, like services running in a network or container.

## Deployed-in Relationship Structure

A deployed-in relationship has the following structure:

```json
{
  "unique-id": "services-in-network",
  "description": "Services deployed in the internal network",
  "relationship-type": {
    "deployed-in": {
      "container": "network-node-id",
      "nodes": [
        "service1-id",
        "service2-id"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Properties

- **container**: The node that contains or hosts the other nodes
- **nodes**: An array of node IDs that are deployed in the container

## Common Use Cases

Deployed-in relationships are typically used to show:

- Services deployed in a network
- Components running in a container platform
- Services hosted in a cloud environment
- Applications installed on a server
