# Connects Relationships

The **connects** relationship type in CALM represents connections between components, typically showing how services communicate with each other or with databases and other components.

## Connects Relationship Structure

A connects relationship has the following structure:

```json
{
  "unique-id": "service-to-database",
  "description": "Service connects to the database to store data",
  "relationship-type": {
    "connects": {
      "source": {
        "node": "source-node-id"
      },
      "destination": {
        "node": "destination-node-id"
      }
    }
  },
  "protocol": "HTTPS",  // Optional but recommended
  "authentication": "OAuth2"  // Optional
}
```

## Key Properties

- **source**: The node that initiates the connection
- **destination**: The node that receives the connection
- **protocol**: (Optional) The communication protocol used (HTTPS, JDBC, etc.)
- **authentication**: (Optional) The authentication method used

## Common Use Cases

Connects relationships are typically used to show:

- API calls between services
- Database connections
- External service integrations
- Message queue connections
