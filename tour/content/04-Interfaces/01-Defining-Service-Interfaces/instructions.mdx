# Defining Service Interfaces

In CALM, **interfaces** define how nodes expose their functionality to other nodes. They represent the specific connection points that services and other components expose for communication.

## Interface Structure

Interfaces are defined as part of a node definition using the `interfaces` property:

```json
{
  "unique-id": "api-service",
  "node-type": "service",
  "name": "API Service",
  "description": "REST API service",
  "interfaces": [
    {
      "unique-id": "api-endpoint",
      "interface-type": "host-port",
      "host": "api.example.com",
      "port": 443
    }
  ]
}
```

## Interface Types

CALM supports several interface types:

- **host-port**: A network interface defined by a host and port
- **url**: A specific URL endpoint
- **queue**: A message queue interface
- **file**: A file-based interface

## Connecting to Interfaces

When defining a `connects` relationship, you can specify which interface the connection is made to:

```json
{
  "relationship-type": {
    "connects": {
      "source": {
        "node": "source-node-id"
      },
      "destination": {
        "node": "destination-node-id",
        "interfaces": ["interface-id"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
