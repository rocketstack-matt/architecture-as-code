   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+C` (or `Cmd+Shift+C` on Mac) to open the preview panel beside the editor
   - Preview appears in a separate panel with tabs for Docify, Template, and Model views

2. **Hybrid Mode** (New!):
   - Right-click a CALM file and select "CALM: Open in Hybrid Editor"
   - Or use `Ctrl+Shift+H` (or `Cmd+Shift+H` on Mac) while editing a CALM file
   - Editor opens with Source and Preview tabs in the same window
   - Switch between tabs to edit or view your architecture model

### Configuration

You can configure the default editor mode in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "calm.editor.defaultMode": "hybrid"  // or "classic"
}
```
